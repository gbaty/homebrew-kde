# Contributing

Firstly, consult [Homebrew's contribution guidelines][homebrew].

homebrew-kde favours the following conventions:

* **Hand-picked formulae**. Please only contribute new formulae for apps you use
  and are willing to maintain. See [somekool/homebrew][somekool] if you're
  looking for an all-inclusive approach.

* **Inline patches**. Unless patches are already maintained by a well-known
  source (such as Macports), we prefer patches be included within the formula
  itself rather than hosted on an external source (e.g. Gist). Please report the
  issue upstream and justify the patch with a comment. See Homebrew's [patch
  conventions][patch] for an example.

Thanks!
